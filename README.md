# Simulate Chaotic Dripping Faucet

## About The Project

The idea of this notebook is to interpret the paper [The Chaotic Dripping Faucet](https://nldlab.gatech.edu/w/images/f/f6/Royer_Caleb_PHYS6268_Royer_FinalPaper.pdf), explaining how a dynamic dripping system can be converted into a chaotic dripping system. In this notebook, we will try the system of differential equations they set up to solve the problem and perform some simulations.
